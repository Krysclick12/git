attr.allowInvalidSource::
	If `--attr-source` cannot resolve to a valid tree object, ignore
	`--attr-source` instead of erroring out, and fall back to looking for
	attributes in the default locations. Useful when passing `HEAD` into
	`attr-source` since it allows `HEAD` to point to an unborn branch in
	cases like an empty repository.
